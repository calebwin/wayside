# wayside
A kind-of-innovative mobile-friendly platformer game I made w. Phaser for the 39th Ludum Dare. In less than a week, it became one of the jam's most popular entry garnering 100+ positive reviews. Using Phonegap Build, I then built the game into a mobile port, launching it on Google Play Store, Amazon Appstore, and Apple App Store.
